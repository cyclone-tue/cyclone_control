#Cyclone_control

This is a git repository containing the code for the cyclone_control ROS package.

This package contains the different nodes and launch files that are used to control the drone.
The nodes currently rely on a mavros node called *mavros* to be running connected to the same master.

Currently these nodes are created:
- Control

The control node takes in messages on the **path** topic and starts executing them on the drone.
It does this by listening for local position data and tracking the progress of the path while flying from point to point.
This node also updates the tf graph. Specifically it sets the relation between **base_link** and **map**.

To send a path to the control node send a `nav_msgs/Path` message to the `path` topic. Only the points and reference frame are used.

**TODO:** include yaw information coming from the path specification when flying.

##Starting the node
Make sure you have mavros a mavros node running. A launch file called `mavros.launch` is included for ease of use.
Start mavros running the following command in a terminal:
`roslaunch mavros.launch fcu_url:=udp://:14551@`
This command assumes that there is a udp mavlink connection available port 14551.

Start the control node by running the following command in a terminal:
`rosrun cyclone_control control`
You might have to source your development environment before this works. Do this by running:
`. ./devel.bash` from your catkin_ws directory.
